# Enhancing Pashto Language Processing

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) has significantly transformed various fields in recent years. However, languages with limited resources, such as Pashto, which is spoken by over 50 million people globally, have often been neglected in research. This repository introduces a comparative analysis and the application of explainable AI techniques like SHAP and LIME for sentiment analysis, specifically designed to enhance understanding of different BERT models.

## Overview

This study focuses on:
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating different BERT models for Pashto language processing.
- **Explainable AI Techniques**: Utilizing SHAP and LIME to provide insights into model predictions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applying these techniques to improve sentiment analysis for Pashto.
- **Resource Creation**: Aiding researchers in identifying and creating essential resources for scientific progress and linguistic inclusion.

The experimental outcomes are highly successful, making a substantial contribution to the advancement of Pashto NLP. This work aids researchers in identifying and creating essential resources for scientific progress and linguistic inclusion.
